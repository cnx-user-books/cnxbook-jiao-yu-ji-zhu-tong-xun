  <md:title>THEORY OF EDUCATION</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Education is becoming increasingly international. Not only are the materials becoming more influenced by the rich international environment, but exchanges among students at all levels are also playing an increasingly important role. In Europe, for example, the Socrates-Erasmus Programme stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the Soros Foundation provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience.</md:abstract>

The division between primary and <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"><emphasis effect="underline">secondary education</emphasis></link> is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age.

The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States and Canada primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K–12_education"><emphasis effect="underline">K-12</emphasis></link> education, and in New Zealand Year 1-13 is used.

        <para id="id9693554">The emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until 1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"><emphasis effect="underline">high schools</emphasis></link> were created and the curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker"><emphasis effect="underline">white collar</emphasis></link> or skilled <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker"><emphasis effect="underline">blue collar</emphasis></link> work. This proved to be beneficial for both the employer and the employee, because this improvement in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just primary educational attainment.</para>

        <title>Technology</title>
        <para id="id7403443">Technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_education"><emphasis effect="underline">online education</emphasis></link> (a type of distance education). This gives students the opportunity to choose what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_learning"><emphasis effect="underline">Multimedia</emphasis></link>, and provides new ways to engage students, such as <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment"><emphasis effect="underline">Virtual learning environments</emphasis></link>. Technology is being used more not only in administrative duties in education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such as <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint"><emphasis effect="underline">PowerPoint</emphasis></link> and <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_whiteboard"><emphasis effect="underline">interactive whiteboard</emphasis></link> is capturing the attention of students in the classroom. Technology is also being used in the assessment of students. One example is the <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response#Audience_Response_Systems"><emphasis effect="underline">Audience Response System</emphasis></link> (ARS), which allows immediate feedback tests and classroom discussions.</para>

        <para id="id4614452">The use of computers and the Internet is in its infancy in developing countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and the attendant high costs of access. Usually, various technologies are used in combination rather than as the sole delivery mechanism. For example, the Kothmale Community Radio Internet uses both radio broadcasts and computer and Internet technologies to facilitate the sharing of information and provide educational opportunities in a rural community in Sri Lanka.<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#cite_note-19#cite_note-19"><sup>[20]</sup></link> The Open University of the United Kingdom (UKOU), established in 1969 as the first educational institution in the world wholly dedicated to open and distance learning, still relies heavily on print-based materials supplemented by radio, television and, in recent years, online programming.<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#cite_note-20#cite_note-20"><sup>[21]</sup></link> Similarly, the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India combines the use of print, recorded audio and video, broadcast radio and television, and audio conferencing technologies.<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#cite_note-21#cite_note-21"><sup>[22]</sup></link></para>

However, many countries have an active <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"><emphasis effect="underline">Ministry</emphasis></link> of Education, and in many subjects, such as foreign language learning, the degree of education is actually much higher than in industrialized countries; for example, it is not at all uncommon for students in many developing countries to be reasonably fluent in multiple foreign languages, whereas this is much more of a rarity in the supposedly "more educated" countries where much of the population is in fact monolingual.</para>

This has been found to be true, once the threshold has been breached, even if the potential economic value of the children's work has increased since their return to school.</para>

        <para id="id7440513">Education is becoming increasingly international. Not only are the materials becoming more influenced by the rich international environment, but exchanges among students at all levels are also playing an increasingly important role. In Europe, for example, the <link url="http://www.erasmus.ac.uk/"><emphasis effect="underline">Socrates-Erasmus Programme</emphasis></link> stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the <link url="http://www.soros.org/"><emphasis effect="underline">Soros Foundation</emphasis></link> provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience.<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#cite_note-32#cite_note-32"><sup>[33]</sup></link></para>
